# Concepts

This application consists of three views:

- **Main View** :: Search and preview options
- **Help View** :: Display this help page
- **Value View** :: Show the current value of an option
- **Scope Select View** :: Select scope to use

A **purple border** indicates the active (focused) view. Keybinds will only work
in the context of the currently active view.

To quit this application, press `Ctrl+C` or `Esc` from the main view.
